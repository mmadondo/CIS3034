# Personal Project: CIS 3034 Client-Side Web Development

During the Fall 2017 semester, I took the CIS 3034 Client-Side Web Development course at my school, The College of St. Scholastica. Because the course involved learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and other web technologies, I decided to make a webpage to track my learning process and progress made.
