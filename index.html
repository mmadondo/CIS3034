                <p>Hi! Welcome to my small corner on the www! I'm Malvern and I am a junior at the College of St. Scholastica in Duluth, MN.<br>I study Computer Information Systems and Mathematics.<br> I am dedicating this site to documenting my progress in CIS 3034 [Client-side Web Development course].<br>Each week, I will record my progress and include work on my assignments. Stay tuned!</p> //endOf intro

                    <h4>Summary of my experience</h4>
                        <p>Prior to this class, I had basic knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. I learned these from my on-campus job and from working on a side project where I made a full-responsive site using a template with boilerplate code.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What I hope to learn in the class</h4>
                        <p>I am looking forward to learning more about front-end web dev, develop my JS programming skills,  Web APIs, different JS frameworks and technologies. I want to be able to make a web extension or web app by the end of the year, even after the class ends.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What did you do this past week? </h4>
                        <p> This week I learned how to create an HTML DOM (<a href="https://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/notes/dom.html" target="_blank">
                            document object model</a>) from a web page's source code as well as how to debug a web page using Developer Tools or a text editor such as CodePen. I also learned how web pages are rendered including the roles of the browser, server, HTML, CSS, and Javascript</p>
                    
                    <h4>What’s in your way?</h4>
                        <p>Finding the best resource(s) to use without overwhelming myself! Having a lot of resources at hand sometimes makes it impossible to even start so I am hoping I will focus on at most 3 main resources that I will refer to as I learn about client-side web dev.</p>
                                       
                    <h4>What will you do next week?</h4>
                        <p>Intro to Javascript coming up. I will go through some basic tutorials and a few of the resources shared. </p>
                    
                    <h4>Impressions + Improvements</h4>
                        <p>Debugging is an interesting excercise! It was helpful going through the code on my own and talking to another student about the errors I found and what I did to resolve them. Also learned from listening to how others were debugging. I want to find a way to close all accordions except the one currently open. This is a javascript fix I think so it shouldn't be that hard to figure out //thanks to Google and eh Stack Overflow.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Resources + Tip of the week</h4>
                        <p>Tip: There is a plethora of resources out there and I think its best that I use a few that are more comprehensive and well-rounded than try to learn it all and use each one.
                        Resources I could use include: <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank">Javascript.com</a>, <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/" target="_blank">Eloquent Javascript</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Mozilla Developer's Network</a>, <a href="https://thenewboston.com" target="_blank">The New Boston </a>and <a href="http://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON website</a>.

                    <h4>What did you do this past week? </h4>
                        <p> This week I learned the basics of JavaScript. We explored how JS interacts with HTML/CSS variables, functions, arrays, popup boxes, etc I also learned about strongly-typed and loosely-typed languages as well as interpreted vs. compiled languages. Made a <a href="http://student.css.edu/CodeDuluth/Malvern/assignment2.html" target="_blank">Dateable Calculator</a> to find out if two people can date given ages.</p>
                    
                    <h4>What’s in your way?</h4>
                        <p>Our discussion this week entailed completing some challenges posted by students in class. My group (Sara, Alex, Jonathan, and I) did very well. I need to go through some challenges posted and find out where I'm getting stuck.</p>
                                       
                    <h4>What will you do next week?</h4>
                        <p>Next week, we will dive into basic JQuery. Time to polish up the JS and get going with JQuery!</p>
                    
                    <h4>Impressions + Improvements</h4>
                        <p>Some really good challenges were posted in the discussion that I want to try to attempt as many as I can and learn more about JS that way!</p>
                    
                    <h4>Resources + Tip of the week</h4>
                        <p>Go through resources from last week and attempt challenges posted by other students. Also check out <a href = "https://github.com/txcsmad" target="_blank">MAD @ University of Texas at Austin  workshops</a></p>
